<p>After 2020 I (and maybe everyone else) needed a break from the computer. I tried walking but it got cold. I tried woodworking, but it go expensive. Finally I've taken to writing in a journal in order to get away from the computer and find a source of analog pleasure and relaxation.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-UM-151-Gel-Pen-0.38-mm-Black/pd/306">Uniball Signo 151</a> - My favorite pen lately is the Uniball Signo 151. It's unassuming with a clear plastic body, a cheap cap and almost not frills, but it writes like a dream. It's mega reliable, it's lightweight, and I bought a bunch of them in almost every colors I could find on Jetpens. I've been tearing thru these pens because they are fun to use, accurate, and precise as any pen I've used, but they do not last very long. I've been using them in 0.7mm but will be moving over to 0.38mm in order to get more writing out of the gel ink.</li>
				<li><ahref="https://unsharpen.com/pen/rotring-600-ballpoint/">Rotring 600 Ballpoint</a>- No one can deny the greatness of the Rotring 600 in its ballpoing form. The pen is also sold as a pencil and used to be a fountain pen and even a roller ball pen but it's peak form is that of a clicky ballpoint. This pen is pure function and very cool looking, with a rectangular metal body, a grip like fine sandpaper, and a heavy weight. It uses a <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen-refill-guide/">Parker-style refill</a> which means there is an endless number of refills available in this single pen. This makes something like the <a href="https://bigidesign.com/products/ti-click-edc-pen">Bigidesign Ti Click</a> pens seem quite silly to me because all the best refills are Parker shape and there are so many of them, why would I need a pen that accept any refill? Back to the Rotring 600: it's fantastic... but a little bit small.</li> 
				<li><a href="https://www.rotring.com/us/mechanical-pencils/265-rapid-pro-mechanical-pencil-3501170949351.html">Rotring RapidPro</a> - The Rapid Pro is like a larger version of the Rotring 600, but unfortunately is has some plastic in the middle, which some peopel (mostly on Reddit /pens) have said can break. I like the larger size of the pen but still feel like it's cheaing on my 600</li>				
								</ul>
								<p>Other pens I've been using but don't feel the need to expand on are the Bic Cristal (here is a <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/875/bic-cristal-pen-gold-standard">fun article</a> on it) in the wide 1.6mm version, the PaperMate Flair (marker or pen?), and the Sharpie S gel which I've newly discovered and don't know enough about yet to talk about.</p>
								<p>Do you know of any of these pens? Have thoughts? Please share via the contact page</a>
								<p>Please stop by next month to learn the pens, pencils, markers, and other analog things I've been enjoying</p>
